If the user doesn’t get the combination right, he/she can press reset to play the round again; if the combination matches the random audio, the user can proceed to the next round.

# Notes
"Farm Choir" is best played on a computer. Although the game was designed with responsive design in mind, due to audio autoplay being disabled in mobile browsers, the user is not able to hear the entire audio sample.
